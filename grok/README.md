# Grok‑1 Example Code

This directory contains a snapshot of the `run.py` file from the
`grok-1` example repository. The Grok‑1 model is a mixture‑of‑experts
language model implemented in JAX. The code here is not intended to
run out of the box; the original repository includes additional
modules (such as `model.py` and `runners.py`) and requires a
significant JAX and Haiku environment to execute. To experiment with
Grok‑1 locally, clone the official repository and follow the
instructions in its README.

In the context of this unified project, the presence of the Grok
example illustrates how one might integrate a third model alongside
the Mini LLaMA baseline and the SECOND hooks. The heavy lifting
required to load the Grok checkpoint is beyond the scope of this
example, but the structure of the driver script is provided for
reference.
